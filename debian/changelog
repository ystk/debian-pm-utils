pm-utils (1.4.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Stop installing sleep.d/55NetworkManager. Current
    NetworkManager does not even expose this API any more, so the
    sleep()/wake() calls just always fail. As NM is apparently able to deal
    with suspends just fine, no need to waste cycles on this.
  * Drop 90-nm-proper-wakeup.patch: Obsolete with above change.
  * Add debian/time-hook-execution.patch: Measure time that hooks take and
    print them in the log. Also, disable actual suspend call to make hook
    optimization/measure turnarounds more convenient. This is not applied by
    default as the date calls themselves add overhead; just keep it in the
    source package for future use.
  * Add 15-video_quirks_on_x86_only.patch: Only run the video quirk handlers
    on x86 and x86_64, as they are quite expensive.
  * Add 16-no-powersave-before-suspend.patch: Calling pm-powersave before
    pm-suspend is very slow, it. e. g. takes > 1.5 seconds on a Nexus 7. This
    does not nearly compensate the potentially slightly slower suspend
    operation in low power mode, so disable it.

  * debian/rules: Remove the journal-commit and readahead scripts. Recent
    measurements have shown that they do not save any power in different

    these two packages should not be used together anyway. (LP: #606160)

pm-utils (1.4.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream release. (Closes: #588587)
    The main improvement is that this ships some generally useful power
    management hooks by default. Note that this conflicts with similar
    packages such as laptop-mode-tools or pm-utils-powersave-policy, so you
    should not enable them and pm-utils at the same time.
    Current hooks when switching to battery:
    - [disable_wol] Disable Wake-on-LAN on ethernet cards
    - [hal-cd-polling] Disable HAL's polling of CD drives for automounting
      them. Note that this HAL functionality is already obsolete in Debian's
      current GNOME, but still being used in current KDE and XFCE desktops.
    - [harddrive] More aggressive harddrive spindown times
    - [intel-audio-powersave] Put ac97 and hda cards to sleep when inactive.
    - [journal-commit, xfs_buffer] Delay ext[34]/ext journal/metadata
      writeback
    - [laptop-mode] Delay hard disk writeback times of dirty caches, to avoid
      spin ups
    - [pcie_aspm] PCI express cards power saving
    - [readahead] More speculative readahead, at the expense of using more
      memory
    - [sata_alpm] Enable SATA link power management
    - [sched-powersave] Try to use fewer cores on multi-core machines
    - [wireless] Reduce RX/TX power when idle on some known-working drivers
      (various Intel chips for now)
  * video-quirks/*
    - Update quirks to latest upstream release pm-quirks-20100619.
  * Drop patches applied upstream
    - debian/patches/05-inspiron-8600-ati-quirk.patch
    - debian/patches/08-fix-lock-file-handling.patch
    - debian/patches/12-man-page-fixes.patch
  * Refresh and update all patches so they apply cleanly.
  * debian/control
    - Demote radeontool to Suggests. The standard Debian/Ubuntu kernels use
      KMS for radeon which makes this tool obsolete. (Closes: #588768)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control: Add hdparm Recommends and ethtool/wireless-tools Suggests,
    for the newly added power saving hooks.
  * debian/control: Conflicts/Replaces: pm-utils-powersave-policy, superseded
    by the now integrated power.d hooks.

pm-utils (1.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1. No further changes.
  * Stop using SLEEP_MODULE="auto".
    In auto mode we use s2ram/s2disk from uswsusp if installed.
    As s2ram does not handle KMS correctly, which is the default for the main
    graphics drivers in squeeze, this causes problems, so we no longer
    suggest the usage of uswsusp and by default use the kernel backend.
    If you want to keep using uswsusp you need to configure this explicitly.
    See the pm-suspend(8) man page for details.

pm-utils (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Don't make dependency on vbetool and uswsusp arch-specific since
      pm-utils is an architecture all package (and we want to keep it so).
      As vbetool and uswsusp are only Recommends resp. Suggests this poses no
      problems for architectures where those dependencies can't be satisfied.

pm-utils (1.3.0~rc3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate:
    - Add native suspend-hybrid method. It initially suspends the box, and
      sets an alarm to wake up in 15 minutes.  If the system is not resumed
      before the alarm goes off, it will wake up and hibernate.
    - pm-utils can now optionally profile the hooks as they run to see which
      ones are taking an unusual amount of time.  See README.debugging for
      more information.
    - pm-utils has its own quirk database that does not rely on HAL.
    - Add --quirk-test parameter that bypasses the sanity checking imposed by
      the quirk database handler for debugging: you can see what happens when
      you post your video card in userspace while running a KMS driver.
  * Drop 01-have-kms-nouveau.patch, applied upstream.
  * debian/watch: Update to use /releases/ and catch release candidates, too.
  * debian/rules: Do not install import-fdi-quirkdb, it's not a general user
    tool but intended for packagers/distros.
  * Add video-quirks/*: Current native video quirk database (from
    pm-quirks-20091205.tar.gz). This might get merged into pm-utils proper,
    and is easier to maintain here for now, in case the format changes again.
  * debian/control: Drop hal recommends.
  * Add 01-fix-DMI-attribute-matching.patch: canonicalize_dmivar() refused the
    valid property "system.firmware.release_date" because of a missing '_' in
    the character filter.
  * Add 03-fix-usage-of-find_native.patch: 98-video-quirk-db-handler expects
    find_native() to write the quirks to stdout, so actually do write them
    there. This makes the native quirks work.
  * Add 04-fix-alternatives-matching-in-native-quirks-DB.patch: The native
    quirks DB separates alternatives with ';'. For regexp matching, turn
    those into '|', so that they will actually match.
  * Add 05-inspiron-8600-ati-quirk.patch: Fix suspend quirks for Dell Inspiron
    8600 with an ATI card. Thanks Kees Cook!
  * Add debian/pm-utils.preinst: Clean up last_known_working.quirkdb on
    upgrades to this version, since previous 1.3 pre-releases did not
    interpret the DB correctly.

      pm-powersave(8) man page. (Closes: #504045)
  * debian/rules
    - Enforce regeneration of all man pages. Apparently lintian is not happy
      with the ones shipped by upstream.

pm-utils (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Fixes the uswsusp module to pass the correct parameters to s2ram when
      using the --quirk-s3-* parameters. (Closes: #448137)
    - Correctly includes multiple config files from /etc/pm/config.d.
      (Closes: #451493, #475565)
    - Correctly restores the cpufreq governors on multi-core machines.
      (Closes: #452620)
    - Fixes filename expansion in current directory. (Closes: #454092)
    - Updated and improved README. (Closes: #425282, #453866)
    - The uswsusp module uses s2ram --force in do_suspend. (Closes: #457019)
      This also means, that the internal whitelist of s2ram is no longer used.
      The preferred way is to get the quirks from hal.
  * debian/control
    - Update the upstream URL and use the new Homepage field. (Closes: #473799)
    - The Vcs-* fields are now officially supported, so remove the XS- prefix.
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3. No further changes required.
    - Fix a small typo in the long package description. (Closes: #466631)
    - Add Build-Depends on quilt.
    - Add Depends on kbd | console-tools. The kernel and tuxonice module
      require the chvt utility. (Closes: #474637)
  * debian/watch
    - Updated. Parse the homepage at http://pm-utils.freedesktop.org/wiki/ for
      the latest release.
  * Removed patches

  * Updated patches
    - debian/patches/80-service.patch
  * debian/patches/10-sleep-module-auto-detection.patch
    - Try to autodetect which sleep module to use. Check tuxonice first, then
      uswsusp and fall back to kernel.
  * debian/patches/15-hibernate_mode_check.patch
    - Add a safety check before writing the hibernate method to
      /sys/power/disk. (Closes: #450515)
  * debian/patches/20-uswsusp-fixes.patch
    - Disable the 99video hook for the uswsusp module. s2ram has it's own vt
      switching functionality.
    - Check if s2ram is available.
  * debian/patches/25-pmu.patch
    - As we don't ship the pm-pmu binary, implement the pmu suspend
      functionality with a bit of perl magic. Thanks to Martin Pitt for the
      idea and the code. (Closes: #450601, #452367, #452909)
    - Prefer the /sys/power/state interface over poking /dev/pmu. This
      requires a Linux kernel >= 2.6.25.
  * debian/pm-action.xml
    - Fix some typos in the pm-action manpage. (Closes: #450414)
    - Document new configuration variables.
    - Improve explanation of the quirk options. (Closes: #475755)
  * debian/copyright
    - Update list of authors.
  * debian/rules
    - The 60sysfont hook is no longer shipped upstream, so we don't have to
      remove it anymore.
    - Switch patch system to quilt.

pm-utils (0.99.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support modules/services with dashes (closes: #433179)

pm-utils (0.99.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make --hibernate test in pm-is-supported less strict so we
    can support suspend2 too (closes: #422745)
  * pm-action: Fix pm-suspend-hybrid support (closes: 427253)
  * Add some more words to the pm-action manpage (closes: #425282)
  * Don't install useless NEWS file (closes: #431551)
  * Add support for NO_QUIRKS from HAL. Now we can distinguish
    between `no quirks' and 'unknown' (closes: #427052)

pm-utils (0.99.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #389817).
  * Do not install on_ac_power binary. Instead depend on powermgmt-base
    package.

  [ Tim Dijkstra ]
  * Support for `s2ram' for hal >= 0.5.9
  * First stab at suspend-hybrid support
  * Do not install pm-pmu, it is hack for old kernels (older than the one
    in etch) which is also present in the s2ram binary if needed.
  * Do not install pm-reset-swap, it has bugs and is superflous since
    swapon in debian has similar functionality.
  * Recommend vbetool and radeontool (not depend on it) else pm-utils
    won't be installable on anything but x86_*
  * Add manpages.
