pm-utils (1.3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1. No further changes.
  * Stop using SLEEP_MODULE="auto".
    In auto mode we use s2ram/s2disk from uswsusp if installed.
    As s2ram does not handle KMS correctly, which is the default for the main
    graphics drivers in squeeze, this causes problems, so we no longer
    suggest the usage of uswsusp and by default use the kernel backend.
    If you want to keep using uswsusp you need to configure this explicitly.
    See the pm-suspend(8) man page for details.

pm-utils (1.3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control
    - Don't make dependency on vbetool and uswsusp arch-specific since
      pm-utils is an architecture all package (and we want to keep it so).
      As vbetool and uswsusp are only Recommends resp. Suggests this poses no
      problems for architectures where those dependencies can't be satisfied.

pm-utils (1.3.0~rc3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate:
    - Add native suspend-hybrid method. It initially suspends the box, and
      sets an alarm to wake up in 15 minutes.  If the system is not resumed
      before the alarm goes off, it will wake up and hibernate.
    - pm-utils can now optionally profile the hooks as they run to see which
      ones are taking an unusual amount of time.  See README.debugging for
      more information.
    - pm-utils has its own quirk database that does not rely on HAL.
    - Add --quirk-test parameter that bypasses the sanity checking imposed by
      the quirk database handler for debugging: you can see what happens when
      you post your video card in userspace while running a KMS driver.
  * Drop 01-have-kms-nouveau.patch, applied upstream.
  * debian/watch: Update to use /releases/ and catch release candidates, too.
  * debian/rules: Do not install import-fdi-quirkdb, it's not a general user
    tool but intended for packagers/distros.
  * Add video-quirks/*: Current native video quirk database (from
    pm-quirks-20091205.tar.gz). This might get merged into pm-utils proper,
    and is easier to maintain here for now, in case the format changes again.
  * debian/control: Drop hal recommends.
  * Add 01-fix-DMI-attribute-matching.patch: canonicalize_dmivar() refused the
    valid property "system.firmware.release_date" because of a missing '_' in
    the character filter.
  * Add 03-fix-usage-of-find_native.patch: 98-video-quirk-db-handler expects
    find_native() to write the quirks to stdout, so actually do write them
    there. This makes the native quirks work.
  * Add 04-fix-alternatives-matching-in-native-quirks-DB.patch: The native
    quirks DB separates alternatives with ';'. For regexp matching, turn
    those into '|', so that they will actually match.
  * Add 05-inspiron-8600-ati-quirk.patch: Fix suspend quirks for Dell Inspiron
    8600 with an ATI card. Thanks Kees Cook!
  * Add debian/pm-utils.preinst: Clean up last_known_working.quirkdb on
    upgrades to this version, since previous 1.3 pre-releases did not
    interpret the DB correctly.

pm-utils (1.2.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Drop 01-modprobe-blacklist.patch again, that was a misunderstanding.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop 03-on_ac_power-devkit-power.patch, we are using on_ac_power from
    powermgmt-base so this patch has no effect and only seems to cause
    confusion.
  * debian/patches/01-have-kms-nouveau.patch

      not "noveau". Thanks to Julien Cristau for spotting this.

pm-utils (1.2.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add 01-modprobe-blacklist.patch: Respect module blacklists when calling
    modprobe on resume. (fd.o #25254)
  * Add 02-logging-append.patch: Do not clear the log file on each operation,
    but instead append to it. This makes debugging of several suspends much
    easier. Thanks to James Westby for the patch! (fd.o #25255, LP #410352)
  * Add debian/pm-utils.logrotate: Rotate above log file.
  * Prevent hibernation after a kernel update:
    - Add debian/kernel-postinst-hibernate-stamp: /etc/kernel/postinst.d/ hook
      to create /var/run/do-not-hibernate stamp.
    - Add debian/no-hibernate-on-kernel-update: sleep.d hook to make
      hibernation fail early if above stamp exists.
    - debian/rules: Install above scripts.
    - Closes: #457515, LP: #350491
  * debian/rules: When building on Ubuntu, revert the effect of
    10-debian-defaults.patch; uswsusp is not supported in Ubuntu. Add
    lsb-release build dependency for this.
  * debian/control: Add myself to Uploaders: with Michael's consent.
  * Add 03-on_ac_power-devkit-power.patch: Try to contact DeviceKit-Power in
    on_ac_power, and if it succeeds, use that. Otherwise fall back to hal.

      /sys/power/disk. (Closes: #450515)
  * debian/patches/20-uswsusp-fixes.patch

  * debian/patches/25-pmu.patch
    - As we don't ship the pm-pmu binary, implement the pmu suspend

      idea and the code. (Closes: #450601, #452367, #452909)
    - Prefer the /sys/power/state interface over poking /dev/pmu. This
      requires a Linux kernel >= 2.6.25.
  * debian/pm-action.xml
    - Fix some typos in the pm-action manpage. (Closes: #450414)
    - Document new configuration variables.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #389817).

  [ Tim Dijkstra ]
  * Support for `s2ram' for hal >= 0.5.9
  * First stab at suspend-hybrid support
  * Do not install pm-pmu, it is hack for old kernels (older than the one
    in etch) which is also present in the s2ram binary if needed.
  * Do not install pm-reset-swap, it has bugs and is superflous since
    swapon in debian has similar functionality.
  * Recommend vbetool and radeontool (not depend on it) else pm-utils
    won't be installable on anything but x86_*
  * Add manpages.
